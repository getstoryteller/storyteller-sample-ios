# Storyteller iOS

This sample app uses our [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) integration (`Storyteller`), so you must:
1. [Install CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
2. Supply your SDK license key in the `Podfile` by replacing `[LICENSEKEY]` with the correct value (please refer to our guide to [Referencing the SDK](https://docs.getstoryteller.com/documents/ios-sdk/Reference) for more details)
3. Run `pod install` in the root directory
4. Open the `StorytellerSampleApp.xcworkspace` to open the project.
5. Supply your app's Api Key in `AppDelegate.swift` by replacing `[APIKEY]` with the correct value (please refer to our guide on [Initializing the SDK](https://docs.getstoryteller.com/documents/ios-sdk/Initialize) for more details)
